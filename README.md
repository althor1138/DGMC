# DGMC-Avisynth
Motion Compensated Grain Removal.

Requirements:

Avisynth 2.6 or newer

MVTOOLS2 or newer

function DGMC(clip input, int "tradius", int "mthresh", int "mthresh2", float "limit", float "limitc", int "blocksize", int "overlap", int "search", int "searchparam", clip "auxclip")

tradius

Temporal Radius. The number of frames analyzed before and after the current frame.

mthresh

Motion Threshold. The cutoff point for denoising. Anything above this threshold does not get denoised.

blocksize

Block Size. Determines how large the blocks generated by MVTOOLS should be. Must be 4,8,16,32, or 64

auclip

Auxiliary Clip. Option to feed MVTOOLS an already denoised clip for generating motion vectors.
